# Issues

1. [sknw](https://github.com/Image-Py/sknw) [version 0.14 was overwritten with 0.15 on pypi](https://github.com/Image-Py/sknw/issues/28). Version 0.15 is unstable on large arrays. Ensure sknw is downloaded using the following command to access the origional version 0.14. The downloaded version will be numbered 0.13, this is correct and the code installed matches what was released as version 0.14 before it was overwritten. 

        pip install git+https://github.com/Image-Py/sknw.git@18f18ab94794964a6dd7a76dd8a2c5c00dab6fd1
